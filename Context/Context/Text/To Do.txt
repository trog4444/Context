add members to all types

rethink how to implement all Linq methods (see ContextCS)
^ test performance with making Linq as extensions (keeping basic ones like map(select), bind(selectmanyx1overload), map2(zip|join), filter(where), etc

'import' all types from old Context (remove Lens), add Stream (one that ends in bool)

test Operators

Consider LINQ methods for Writer type :: they do NOT transfer (due to member constraints)
